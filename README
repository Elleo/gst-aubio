gst-aubio
---------

This module contains a GStreamer plugin for aubio (http://aubio.org/).

Current elements
================

 - aubiotempo: tempo tracking using aubio_tempo
 - aubiopitch: pitch extraction using aubio_pitch

Known limitations
=================

 - mono: for now, the caps allows only for a single input channel.
 - no pitch messages: using the messaging system for each pitch candidate
   sounds like a bad idea.
